# TODO for CMakeCatch2

## General
- Finish the basic setup of Library so it compiles something.
- Finish the basic setup of Desktop so it compiles something.
- Finish the basic setup of Plugin so it compiles something.
- Do the basic setup of Embedded so it compiles something - this should start with a CubeMX project.
- Deal with how user can add other repos - maybe a py file created on new project?
- Output projects are compiled using Docker, GitHub Actions, or a local environment.
